        # types of sensors:
        # introspective (organism health, position etc.)
        # entity property
        # vector field (scents, sounds, heat, etc.)
        # environment (time, terrain, etc.)
        # storage (retrieves values set by previous brain simulation passes)
        # constant
        # oscillator (note - different powers of 10ms should be plenty, no need to have every frequency)
